**PMC-M**

This is an implementation of Poor Man's Compressions - Mean, this algorithm splits the dataset into a specified number of segments. Then algorithm replaces the segment with the average value for each feature. This is a lossy algorithm that can have a very high compression ratio but in exchange for the loss of detailed data.
